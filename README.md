# lossless_cut

The Lossless Cut scrip to use userjobs in conjunction with MythTV's commflag and editing UI to create loss less cut mkv video files.
Lossless Cut supports multiple video, audio encoding types and subtitles formats.

This is updatec to python3 and mythtv v32 version of R.D. Vaughan work.

NOTE: currently script needs to mediainfo v0.7.xx for correct working
I'll update to current mediainfo when time allows

For install/config - see: https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Lossless_Cut
